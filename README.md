# Telecom_Churn-EDA_and_Intractive_Dashboard-
Telecom churn, often referred to as customer churn or subscriber churn, is a significant concern in the telecommunications industry. Churn refers to the phenomenon where customers or subscribers switch from one telecom service provider to another or discontinue their subscription to telecom services altogether. This can result from various factors, including dissatisfaction with the service, better offers from competitors, or changes in the customer's needs

How much costumers have been churned in each state?
How much charges have been charged for churned and non churned customers?
How much charges have the costumers been charged?
how much international plans have been chosen for churned costumers?
